The project is based on the tutorial "TowerDefense" by Abdelrahman Saher - Unity 5.x 2D Game Development Blueprints
(https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unity-5x-2d/9781784393106/),

but it does not copy them (ui-interface from book, but not code).

The project uses only freeware files (sprite and shaders-halo). 

Used free sprite pack - http://player26.com/product/asset-pack-tower-defense-pack/.

The project is aimed at beginners in developing games for unity.
